# Email-Validator

This application receives list of emails, validates them against their syntax as
well as their domain name, classifies and eventually writes them into output files.

# How to use?

Write your to-be-classified emails in the userInputs.txt file located at ```./src/main/resources```. Each line should have only email. After a successful run, the app creates three output files (as text) located at ```./target``` 

For sake of clarity, I have put a list of emails in 
[userInputs](./Project/src/main/resources/userInputs.txt), built and ran the application. So, you can see the [output results](./Project/target)
